/**
 * Service responsible for generating comprehensive reports on the loading status of entities
 * into the database. This class provides an "overall status" of BaseTypes and RegularTypes,
 * indicating which entities have been successfully persisted and their respective counts.
 *
 * <p>It embodies the production-ready implementation of the database entity load verification
 * logic initially sketched and tested within {@code CsvCheckDbmsBeforeLoadIntoDatabaseTest2}.</p>
 *
 * <p>Adherence to SOLID Principles:</p>
 * <ul>
 * <li><b>Single Responsibility Principle (S):</b> This service strictly adheres to the Single
 * Responsibility Principle. Its sole purpose is to provide reporting on the status of
 * entities loaded into the database. It does not concern itself with the actual process
 * of loading CSV data, transforming beans, or persisting entities; it only queries and reports
 * on their presence and quantity.</li>
 * <li><b>Liskov Substitution Principle (L):</b> While not directly involving an inheritance
 * hierarchy at this specific point, the design implicitly supports the Liskov Substitution
 * Principle. Should there be future specialized implementations or subclasses of this service
 * (e.g., for different reporting formats or data sources while maintaining the core "database entity load report" contract),
 * they would be expected to behave in a manner consistent with this base service, ensuring
 * substitutability without altering correctness.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>This service is annotated with {@link DatabaseReport}, a custom stereotype annotation that
 * further clarifies its role as a report-generating service specifically focused on database-related
 * loading information.</p>
